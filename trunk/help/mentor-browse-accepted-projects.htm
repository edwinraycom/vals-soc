<h1>Accepted projects you are mentoring</h1>
<p>Once a student has accepted one of your project offers, he/she is
	recorded in the system as now taking that project during the Semester
	of code. You should be notified by email that a student has accepted
	your offer. To access your accepted projects use the 'My accepted
	projects' link.</p>

</p>
<p>Here there are two options.</p>
<p>
	The 'project agreement' link is a simple form designed to allow you,
	the student and the supervisor to specify any additional information
	regarding the project work to be undertaken, such as milestones and
	delivery dates. (<strong>Note</strong> - <em>this is optional and
		only needed if required.</em>)
</p>
<p>The 'Project details' link opens a tabbed view of the project
	within a dialog. The dialog window contains six tabs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Overview</strong> - <em>contains an overview of
			the proposal and allows you to add comments to it, which in turn are
			emailed back to the student and supervisor.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Student Details</strong> - <em>lists the students
			details, which institution he/she is attending and their supervisors
			details.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Summary</strong> - <em>the students
			brief proposal synopsis</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Description</strong> - <em>the students
			detailed proposal text</em></li>
	<li><strong>Project</strong> - <em>is a reference back to the
			project idea you initially created</em></li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - <em>is now set to accepted by
			the student</em>.</li>
</ul>
