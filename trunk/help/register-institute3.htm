<h1>How to invite/enroll students in the Semester of Code VPS</h1>
<p>
	To invite students related to your Institution, you need to first
	create a group and then invite students to this group. This group can
	represent students of a course, of one faculty or department.
	Alternatively your group can simply represent all the students from
	your university. You can have one or more groups, simply use this
	feature as you need.<br /> <br /> To create the group navigate to
	your <i>Dashboard</i> and click on the <i>Groups</i> link. If this is the first
	time you are creating a group, then there should be a blue 'add' button
	shown at the top right corner.

</p>
<p>You will need to fill the different fields of the form (name of
	the group and optionally a description of the group).</p>
<p>Once you have created the group, if you navigate to <i>Dashboard</i>
	then <i>Groups</i> you will see a page similar to previously explained for
	the invitation of institute admins and academic supervisors. Within
	this page you will see the code (9 characters) for students (the code
	is needed when they register in the platform) or a button to send them
	an email with the registration instructions.</p>
