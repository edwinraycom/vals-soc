    <h1>Proposal status and making the student an offer</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you have received a proposal for one of  your project ideas, you have a few options on which course of action to take. As described <a href="timeline.htm#workflow">here</a> in the workflow section, you can optionally either...</p>
    <ul>
    	<li><em> accept one proposal as your interim choice. This means that although it is your current preferred proposal for this project idea, you may still change your mind later.<br />
    		</em></li>
    	<li><em> accept one proposal as your final choice. This means that you have decided to offer the project to the student who created this particular proposal.  (Note - the student still has to 'accept' it)</em></li>
    	<li><em> reject a particular proposal, but also giving some sort of feedback on why. </em></li>
    	</ul>
    <p>Accepting a particular proposal as your interim choice lets both the student and his/her supervisor know that their proposal is the best one suited at the present time, while showing other students that their proposal may need to be revisited/amended in order for you to choose it instead. (Note: you could also do this via the comments facility)</p>
    <p>Accepting a particular proposal as your final choice means that you are making this student an 'offer'. the student is emailed to let them know that you have chosen their proposal. The student must then login into the system and 'accept' it. While waiting for the student to accept it, you will be unable to change the offer to another students proposal. If the student accepts the offer, all other proposals are archived and this student now is taking your project idea for the semester of code. If the student chooses another offer from yours, then your 'offer' will be retracted and you will be able to 'offer' the project idea to another students proposal instead. You will be informed of the outcome by email, so you will be notified when to take action.</p>
    <p>If you decide to reject a proposal, you should add some comments on the reasons why.</p>
    <p>To navigate to a particular students proposal you wish to take action on, browse to a proposal as explained <a href="mentor-browse-proposals.htm">here</a> and open the proposal detail.</p>
    <p><img src="images/mentor-proposal-status.jpg" width="700" height="374" /></p>
    <p>Click the 'status' tab from the proposal detail dialog to choose which option you wish to take.</p>
