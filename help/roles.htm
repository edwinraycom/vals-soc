    <h1>Roles and accounts</h1>
    <h2>User Accounts</h2>
    <p> Some   portions and features of the website are available only to those   actively participating in the program in some capacity. Registration can only be made by obtaining the correct code and is not open to everyone by default.  These codes can be obtained from the <a href="participate.htm">JISC mailing list</a>, or a project partner if you are an organisation or institution. If you are a student, then your supervisor will send you the correct code. Generally you can use any email address when registering.Â All email communication from the system will be sent to the address you specify during registration. Once registered you should be sent a one time activation link, where you can go to and set your password.</p>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>Your   profile type on the website will be determined by the role with which   you participate in the program. The roles within the system are very similar to the Google Summer of Codes ones, except we also have additional roles for the academic side. The roles are explained below.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>Program Administrator</strong><br />
    		The user/s who has the ability to oversee and administer the system. <br />
    		</li>
    	<li><strong>Organisation Administrator</strong><br />
    		This user is typically the first person to register from a given organisation wishing to put forward project ideas (although an organisation can have multiple of these). The organisation administrator usually enters the details for the participating organisation which is found on the <em>organisations</em> link on the front page. They can invite other mentors and admins to join their organisation by sending out the correct code by email. Additionally, they can create project ideas and also act as a mentor.<br />
    		</li>
    	<li><strong>Mentor</strong><br />
    		Mentors receive account signup codes from an organisation administrator. The mentor registers and is able to create new project ideas for students. During the proposal/student signup period they can review proposals submitted by students and decide which one to to accept and then mentor in the main period.<br />
    		</li>
    	<li><strong>Institute Administrator</strong><br />
    		Like the organisation administrator, this is usually the first person to register from a particular academic institution or university. The institute administrator usually enters the details for the participating university which is found on the <em>institutes</em> link on the front page. They can invite other supervisors and admins to join their institution by sending out the correct code by email. Additionally, they can invite students and also act as a supervisor on one or more projects.<br />
    		</li>
    	<li><strong>Supervisor</strong><br />
    		Supervisors
    		receive account signup codes from an institute administrator. A Supervisor can create groups within the system and invite students to participate within that group. (analogous to a class) They can recommend particular project ideas as ones they think would be good ones for students to write proposals for &amp; that particular supervisor could supervise.<br />
    		</li>
    	<li><strong>Student </strong><br />
    		Students are invited into the system by receiving a new signup code by supervisors and/or institution administrators. Students can browse the project ideas list and choose to create one or more proposals. (With the help of their supervisor) Proposals can eventually become accepted projects after the creating mentor has first made an 'offer' to the student and that student has 'accepted' it.<br />
    		</li>
    	</ul>
	<p>Information and website   features will be accessible or inaccessible in part depending on your   role.</p>	
    <p>What you see on the site changes depending on the active phase of <em>VALS Semester of Code</em> and on your role in the program. If you don't see what you expect to see, take a moment to:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>ensure that you are logged in</li>
    	<li>confirm the current phase of the program</li>
    	</ul>
    <h2>Timekeeping</h2>
    <p>All dates and times on the website are expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).</p>
